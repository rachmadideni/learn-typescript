#### Why Do I need TypeScript ?
<b>TypeScript</b> provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking. TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand. With TypeScript, we can make a huge improvement over plain JavaScript. TypeScript gives us all the benefits of ES6 (ECMAScript 6), plus more productivity. 

The goal of TypeScript is to help catch mistakes early through a type system and to make JavaScript development more efficient.

#### Do i need ESLint with TypeScript ?
When it comes to linting <b>TypeScript</b> code, there are two major linting options to choose from: TSLint and <b>ESLint</b>. TSLint is a linter that <b>can</b> only be used for <b>TypeScript</b>, while <b>ESLint</b> supports both JavaScript and <b>TypeScript</b>. ... For that reason, I <b>would</b> recommend using ESLint for linting TypeScript projects.
